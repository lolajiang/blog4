## Part I: “Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards.”―Soren Kirkegaard
In the dry season of the mid-1980s, my father waited in line at the transit center in the big market of the city of Lomé in Togo as he did the previous year. This time, he was a man in love, married to my mother, who is also by his side and a couple of weeks pregnant with their first — me. There were thousands more like him across Togo and the surrounding Western African countries at large, hoping that day after day, to save or borrow just enough money to cover the transit fare to Nigeria.

The aim is to make it to Nigeria’s largest city of Lagos sprawls inland from the Gulf of Guinea across the Lagos Lagoon, to be selected as a manual laborer. Manual labor or manual work is physical work done by humans, in contrast to the job by machines and working animals. It is most literally tasks done with the hands, and, by figurative extension, with any of the muscles and bones of the body. It’s been an unspoken long-standing tradition among surrounding Western African countries for their underserved and underrepresented citizens, mostly young men with no special skills or training, little or no education, to make the trip to Nigeria to offset worker shortages. The shortage is due to the bitter civil war fought between the government of Nigeria and the failed secessionist state of Biafra in 1967–1970 that claimed more than 3 million lives.

While thousands waited, only a few were selected to be manual laborers by the Oga — a local slang used to refer to the boss or someone in a position of authority. As a teenager, my father has set his heart on being a Businessman. Still, family hardships had made it impossible due to the passing of his father, and little or no inheritance left due to much older sibling rivalry in a polygamous family. After missing that opportunity, he was determined to become a manual laborer. He was unsuccessful the previous year. After multiple failed attempts, traveling across Nigeria, and meeting different Ogas, he was finally selected.

As an unskilled laborer, my father performed long hours of backbreaking work building and laying bricks, digging foundations of new construction sites, and running mundane errands of his Oga. For my father, this means leaving my mother and me behind for months in the slum. Enduring harsh conditions, he earned less than 50¢ an hour. Treatments of manual laborers by their Oga and conditions at large were often brutal. These are conditions that violated many Nigerian laws and common human decency. At the same time, however, this is not a matter of law or gentlemen’s agreements; it’s a matter of survival.

Later in life, my father told me the day he was selected to be a manual laborer was the day he succeeded in life. Knowing what he had been through, I was more than a little confused by his remarks. I would have expected anger at this deprivation, ill-treatment, and low wages he was forced to endure. But my father had a different perspective. His own mother decided to become the thirteenth wife due to hardship, no education, and limited opportunity in a highly patriarchal society where everything is a zero-sum game in the most real sense of the word. My father’s single-minded aim was to end his family’s poverty cycle to avoid the horrors growing up in the impoverished formal francophone nation of Togo, mired in intergenerational poverty.

Despite his struggles, he would offer me something more than he had. There was no sacrifice too high and no condition too harsh for him to bear when it came to providing for us.

## Part II: “So much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family, that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty.”―Haniel Long
In 1994, I now had two siblings — Raphael and Lucky. At this time, my father owns a small bricklaying business in Lagos. He moved his young family to a bungalow he constructed on the little land he bought. We lived in this three-bedroom home filled with some love but very few luxuries. Four years later, I had a sister, Joy. Of the four kids in our family, I was the oldest.

From an early age, I grew accustomed to waking up at 4:30 a.m. to help my mother secure fresh loaves of bread from the local bakery she sells, amongst other goods, to make a living. I also completed domestic chores, ready my siblings for school, and make it to the student assembly by no later than 8:00 a.m. to avoid being disciplined by teachers for being late. I still hate being late for any function regardless of its occasion. By some unspoken virtue, these teachers seem to have life and death authority over you, and parents are okay with it. That was how the teachers keep students focused purely on their education and from other distractions.

Every year just before the rainy season is over, the school year comes to a close, and we will assist my father at work. Since I was good with numbers and attention to detail, so I helped with accounting, bookkeeping, and payroll. My mother focused on the supply chain. My siblings helped to make customers feel welcomed, and my father focused on the bigger picture to expand the business.

By the second week of January, we are back in school, wearing the new clothes we bought with money we earned from helping with the business, trying to catch up on the lessons we missed. As I advanced through the academic ranks, it was becoming difficult to balance school work and working to contribute to the family.

I would still get time to play soccer — the only sport I genuinely fell in love with because it requires leading irrespective of the position one plays, extreme ownership and teamwork, executing, winning, and never complaining. They were loose conversations about the chances of becoming a professional soccer player until I damaged my left leg. Though I didn’t mind, I kept calm and did what’s needed to succeed academically instead. What was healthy for me seemed as if it was typical for everyone.

By the time I was in junior high, though, I was aware that while my hardworking parents were doing their best, the difference between our family and others was plain to see. Though I never felt ashamed, I was very defensive of what others might know or say about us. When my mother sends me to buy provisions at the local market, I will bargain for every product to achieve quantity and quality and take the long road home so I can get back just when it’s getting dark so no one would see me. It was a game of saving face, which I played to make our family look the same as everyone else’s.

## Part III: “In youth we learn; in age we understand.”―Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach
It wasn’t until I was sixteen, in the United States of America for my collegiate career — two weeks into my Freshman year — bracing the gruesome long winter season, the awful loneliness that comes by being so far away from loved ones, and coming to terms with the disgusting processed meals from the cafeteria, I began to re-evaluate my upbringing. I found that most of the International Students were unprepared for the long hours of classes, the casual demeaning racism, and profanity from the locals because of the tone of our skin, and the systematic breakdown of everything we thought to be true about ourselves.

As these students around me complained one cold, freezing evening, I realized it was not that different from the life I had lived at home. I had already endured years of hardship. I had previously encountered blatant xenophobia in Nigeria despite being a citizen at birth and spoke the Yoruba, Ewe, and Mina languages fluently. Also, at that time, I was already accustomed to living without material comforts or much free time.

That evening it occurred to me that what I had already experienced was as tight as I would face in the next few years. For the first time, having struggled early in life was turning to be an advantage. It felt like a gift not to worry whether I would make it through my collegiate career or survive in the United States where the majority of its “white” citizens — so-called law and order tough on crime “Republicans,” Moses syndrome do-nothing “Democrats,” undecided Third-party “voters,” down with the patriarchy “feminist,” love is love LGBTQ “right campaigners,” All Lives Matter “correctionists,” Blue Lives Matter “sympathizers,” “elite” and “ivy-league” colleges and institutions, god-fearing “evangelicals,” ill-conceived “conservatives,” ill-advised fake “liberals,” over-educated “progressives,” self-absorbed “independents,” misguided “constitutionalists” and “textualists” law enforcers, district attorneys, and judges — hide under the blanket of the ideals of freedom but systematically continue to oppress anyone who doesn’t look or speak like them.

Racism, one of the many physical manifestations of Caste, is more than a feeling; it’s a system in which these “people” can and do exploit their social positions, assumptions about their innocence, and the presumption that they’re telling the truth. Rather than taking concrete actions to make things right, these “people” are more concerned with not being perceived as racist than dealing with racism and casteism within themselves. What these “people” failed to fundamentally understand is that like all systems; systems of oppression, inequality, and inequity are by design. Therefore, they can be redesigned. Instead, when folks of non-European or African Americans mention their harsh conditions, their history, or existence, these “people” call it reverse racism.

To bring clarity to the matter is to understand that Caste which lays the foundation for Racism and the other negative forms of ism is at the core and center of understanding the attitude of these “people” towards the folks of non-European Americans especially African Americans. In 1981, Lee Atwater, Campaign Strategist to Ronald Regan puts it plainly when he was cut on tape saying:

“You start out in 1954 by saying nigger, nigger, nigger. By 1968 you can’t say nigger, that hurts you. It backfires. So you say stuff like forced-bussing, state’s rights, and all that stuff. You’re getting so abstract now. You’re talking about cutting taxes [zip-codes, gerrymandering, good school districts, blue-collar jobs, homeowner associations, condo fees, religious freedom, gentrifications, gated-communities, safe neighborhoods, Make America Great Again, Take Our Country Back, law and order, credits scores, war on drugs, etc.] All of these things you’re talking about are totally economic things. And the by-product of them is blacks [Non-European Americans especially African Americans] get hurts worse than whites [European Americans.]”

Ronald Regan won the presidency that year and was known for passionately stating that:

“Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn’t pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same.”

One might conclude that Ignorance is bliss, but Jim Rohn said it best:

“Ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is poverty. Ignorance is devastation. Ignorance is tragedy. And Ignorance is illness. It all stems from Ignorance.”

Ignorance is Ignorance.

So, here are the facts, and make no mistakes:

European Americans have not always been “white,” nor will they always be “white.” There’s nothing intellectually appealing about being “white” because the world is not “white;” it never was “white,” and cannot be “white.” To be “white” is a metaphor for grotesque power designed by European Americans in the order for them to escape their own harsh reality of being the descendants of thieves, rapists, cowards, and murderers. It is a twisted political alliance built on the bedrock of ethical and moral bankruptcy. In a sense, and from a deep philosophical and intellectual inquiries, and unbeknownst to the framers and to the majority of these so-called "white" citizens, things will change because the United States of America as a system which is built on the ideals of John Locke, evangelized by Thomas Paine, written in stone by James Madison, and brought to fruition by George Washington and his Continental Army operates on the honor code, and no matter how slow its progress in its quest for a more perfect union, there’s no place in it for being “white.”

To set the record straight, there are no "black" people in Africa. Africans are not "black." They are Ewe, Xhosa, Yoruba, Igbo, Zulu, Tutsi, Hausa, Hutu, Akan, Ndebele, and the list goes on. They are just themselves, and that is who they are. Asians are not "yellow." They are Han, Yamato, Zhuang, Uyghurs, and so on. Europeans are not "white." They are Slavs, Romani, Finns, Poles, and so forth. And, Hispanic are not "brown." That logic applies to all ethnic groups of people in other continents around the world.

In the United States, my adopted country of residence, it is safe to say at a micro level that there are African Americans, European Americans, Caribbean Americans, Asian Americans, Middle Eastern Americans, Hispanic Americans, and many more. At a macro level, they are Americans and nothing more. The terms Black, White, Brown, Yellow, and so forth are divisive and only reinforce the negative outcomes of Caste.

The point here is to do away with harmful artificial labeling and grouping of people primarily based on colorism or what they look like. People are not aliens. People are people. Humans are not illegal. Humans are humans. Love is love. To think or suggest otherwise, is a war against truth, against what the eye can see, and what the heart could feel if allowed to do so on its own.

Nevertheless, I never questioned whether I could handle the cultural shock, the grueling physicality, and the mental strain demanded from International Students or any resident of the United States under a strict conditional visa with little or no means to make a living. I simply needed to draw on the persistence, strength, and resilience I already had.

I was extremely grateful for the sacrifices my parents had made. Still, it took longer to internalize that my father — a humble, sturdy peasant — had accomplished his goal for our family. Even though it didn’t feel like it as a child, he had succeeded in providing opportunities for his children that were never available to him.

Eventually, I began to study in earnest what struggle had taught me, why I should be grateful for it, and I could apply the lessons it offered. In each case, it gave me a gift. I realized that I could often look back to an event from my past to find the clarity I needed. When I find myself facing a new challenge, my life experience could provide a unique story and a crucial lesson to add to what I knew.

## Part IV: “You can play a shoestring if you’re sincere.”―John Coltrane
John Coltrane is arguably amongst one of the most influential figures in my life. In actuality, it’s a toss-up between Coltrane; James Baldwin, the African American novelist and activist; Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore; and the stoic philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius, the Roman Emperor from 161 to 180 AD.

I feel Coltrane single-handedly represents the struggle and all the demons we face through our journey in life. We all reach a tipping point where we have to stare into the abyss, the abyss gazes back at you, but with one exception: You have to fight back, be on the path to righteousness, and be one with nature without complaining or getting stuck in the victim cycle.

Coltrane was able to accomplish this through Jazz by playing his saxophone despite being set against all social, political, and cultural lands of his time. His action demonstrates one of courage and the true definition of accountability. He went on to create boundary-shattering Jazz records that continue to influence all music genres to this day.

A Love Supreme is my personal favorite of his work. If you want something more profound and intellectually stimulating, I recommend his Jazz album Ascension recorded in June 1965 and released in 1966. 

Coltrane’s story taught me to live the most minimalist life, embrace the art of plain-speaking, and the framework of quiet leadership. It has been a blessing to be a student of his life and work and to have his music be a source of comfort and inspiration during my most difficult years in the United States.

## Part V: “Think different”―Steve Jobs
In a sense, the most impactful people I know are often the ones who have a hell-raiser trait in them, regardless of whether this comes from nature or nurture. These are people who think differently, feel different, behave differently. These are the people who can’t easily fit into the square box.

People both value and despise them. They make people uncomfortable. They challenge thoughts, processes, and the status quo. They disrupt and dismiss. They push. They raise the bar for everyone else, and they call people out. They’re not being difficult on purpose — they’re being themselves. They see things differently. And, that comes with both opportunities and challenges. I must attest that I am extremely guilty of these traits and behavior in every aspect of my being.

For as long as I can remember, I have always maintained that it’s never too late to be whoever I want to be. There’s no time limit; I can stop whenever I want. I can change or stay the same; there are no rules to this thing. I can make the best or the worst of it. I hope I make the best of it. And, I wish I continue to see something that startles me. I hope to continue to feel things I’ve never felt before. I hope I meet people with a different point of view. I wish to live a life I am proud of. If I find that I am not, I hope I have the strength to start all over again.

The majority of the people I come across find me fascinating. For the life of me, I don’t get it. I do know that they want me to let them in. But, I am a dispassionate trained stoic. So, that rarely happens ―thanks to Marcus Aurelius. It happens with very few because of the way they listened. I don’t present it as empathy. Though, I have come to understand that underneath that uninflected gaze of mine, that’s what’s there ―empathy.

I am a proud son of the Ewe people ―an ethnic group in West Africa. A member of the historical family clan and lineage of Alognon ―which loose translation in English means the "Good Hands" or the "Gifted Hands." Concerning nationality and citizenship, I am a Togolese by heritage, a Nigerian by birth, an American by choice, and a global citizen by my inalienable rights as a human being. I am an Atheist and a Free Thinker. I believe in Science, Logic, Reason, Facts, Truth, and the pursuit of happiness. I feel deeply. I care deeply. I try to solve all the problems I see.

It’s what makes me who I am.
